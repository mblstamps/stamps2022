## Instructions for students

Directive: **Reconstruct the text** from the shotgun sequencing in the PDF/paper handouts.

Working individually or in groups, please reconstruct the original text for the handouts I'm giving you. You may use the computer to organize information, but please don't google the text...

Rules:

* no googling please!
* use of a text editor is fine!

Useful information:

* all fragments are from the same text
* paired-end sequences are separated by commas; they come from the same text, a fixed distance apart;
* PDFs of the handouts are also available on slack.
* this is _not_ a metagenome: we sequenced a single text, uniform coverage

Questions!
* what advantages do you have in this exercise over doing this with DNA?
* what are the pluses and minuses of the different datatypes?
    * e.g. which are more useful, the long or short reads?
* does the organization of reads matter?
    * e.g. does sorting the reads alphabetically help or hinder?
* if you use a reference, how do you know it's the right reference?
    * (what strategies might you use to validate your assembly?)
* what is/was your strategy for doing this? is it effective?
    * how would you scale up to a lot more data/a lot bigger text?
* how would your strategy change if I told you you could have as many undergrads as you wanted to do this?
